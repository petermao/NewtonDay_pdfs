# Newton Day pdfs

...from 2006 to the present.  Github's pdf preview doesn't always show
the whole file, so if you want to see the complete files, then
download individual files or the whole set.

# Bounties

Email me if you find any typos or technical errors.  Typos are worth
$0.25 each, while technical errors will net you $1.00.  Rewards are
arbitrated by the person who collects the most in bounties from me the
previous year.

# What is this?

Every year, since my first kid was born, I've written up a short paper
in honor of Sir Isaac Newton, on the anniversary of his birthday, 
December 25.  I always try to incorporate some activity to do with them
related to the topic of the year.  The technical parts of the papers 
are generally written for them when they reach high school or college,
although I do try to include something they can follow.  This, of course,
is easier to do as they learn more mathematics.
