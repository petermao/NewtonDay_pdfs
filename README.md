# What is this?

Every year, since my first kid was born, I've written up a short paper
in honor of Sir Isaac Newton, on the anniversary of his birthday, 
December 25.  I always try to incorporate some activity to do with them
related to the topic of the year.  The technical parts of the papers 
are generally written for them when they reach high school or college,
although I do try to include something they can follow.  This, of course,
is easier to do as they learn more mathematics.
